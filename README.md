Backstory: This game is a simulation of the peak Amico madness and a tribute to all the people involved in the intellivision Amico saga! One man's vision and mission to be the 4th major console in the video gaming market by targeting it's 'big gaping hole', a console for the casual, non-gamers called, Amico. Founded by Tommy Tallarico and his company Intellivision Entertainment. With over 600 years of industry experience, they decided to skip the game development phase and went straight into console hardware development and publishing, what could possibly go wrong!! 

While being president, CEO, and CCO (lead game designer, writer and musician), Tommy befriended Youtubers and spoke on many podcasts to spread his message of 'together again', '10 commandments' and SAFE, 'Simple, Affordable, Family, Entertainment'.

He claimed to be open and transparent but spoke in vague and non committal terms and wasn't always clear, leaving the audience with more questions then answers. And all this attracted him criticism. Being a legendary industry icon, he chose to get personal and lash out, which his new friends would parrot, fueling a dark comedy, 'micro influencer' culture war!  

Bonusode: Progress through the levels to unlock Amico exclusives content and secrets!

Now choose a side, your favorite personality and do battle in peak Amico madness!
